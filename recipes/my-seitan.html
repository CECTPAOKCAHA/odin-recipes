        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>
            Seitan is a high-protein food that absorbs the flavour of its sauce and therefore
            very versatile.
        </p>

        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <p>For 4 servings</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vital Gluten - 270 g</li>
            <li>Pea or hemp isolated protein powder - 120 g</li>
            <li>Soy sauce - 4 tbsp</li>
            <li>Liquid smoke - 1 tsp</li>
            <li>Nutmeg ground - 1 tsp</li>
            <li>Allspice ground - tsp</li>
            <li>Water - 1.5 cups (might need to adjust depending on the humidity)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients to yield a rubbery dough ball that doesn't stick to your 
            fingers.</li>
            <li>Use Instant Pot steamer, steam for 20 minunes on medium pressure setting.</li>
            <li>Cut into stripes and further stir fry or barbeque, or use in stews. You 
            can also steam it on the stove using a traditional steamer, but you will need
            to cut the dough ball into smaller pieces and steam for 40 mins.</li>
        </ol>
